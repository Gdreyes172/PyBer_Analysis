# Purpose:
## The pupose of this report was to describe and compare how different city types perform in their average fare price, how many rides the drivers of each city type conducts, and to find patterns based on this data.
## Overview:
### We used the fare prices, number of rides, and the driver id to identify differences in the city types they operate in. Our findings were focused on the need for average fare price, number of drivers available per city type, and number of rides conducted per city type. Using the available data we were able to create several figures that represent the distinct difference between rural, suburban, and urban cities.

# Results:

## The Ride-Sharing Data above shows the average fare price as a function of the number of rides per each city type. The size of the buble correlates to the drivers number of rides.

## The figure above shows a more descriptive looke at the number of rides per city type.

## Figure 3 when compared to figure 2 shows an inverse result. Here we see that there is an overall lower cost for fares in urban cities thant those of rural cities.

## Finaly, the result of our final analysis showing the average fare price per city type as a function of time.

# Conclusion: 
## Our results show a pattern of urban cities out performing other city types in terms of rides but with lower cost per ride. There could be several factors that can play a role in these figures. More data could elaborate if distance travelled between the ride locations and time spent during the drive plays a role in the way the fare price is observed. It was also clear that there were some drivers that were extraordinary at their jobs. Overall, the data would suggest fare prices are on average cheaper in urban areas than in any other city type.
